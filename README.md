# prog1-2023-shell
This repo branch contains the shell for program 1 from cg class 2023 at nc state (ray tracing ellipsoids).

So, for rendering triangles from triangle2.json, I have created a new file triangleRender.js which implements ray casting algorithm.

Also, I have updated index.html to display triangleRender.js

Somehow, I am not able to render pink polygon properly.
