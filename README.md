# prog1-2023-shell
This repo branch contains the shell for program 1 from cg class 2023 at nc state (ray tracing ellipsoids).

# Part 1 & Part 2 - 

So, for rendering triangles from triangle2.json, I have created a new file triangleRender.js which implements ray casting algorithm.

Also, I have updated index.html to display triangleRender.js

use http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html for checking part1 and part2

# Extra-credits - 

I have implemented spheres as well using ray casting algorithm taught in lecture.

For that, I have created sphereRender.js file

use http://127.0.0.1:5500/index1.html for checking sphere implementation for extra -credit

# Part 3 - 

for part 3, I have implemented Logo of Retail Corporation - TARGET using sphere rendering algorithm.
I have also played with lights to make it shine better.

I have created part3.js for implementing part 3.

use http://127.0.0.1:5500/index2.html for checking part3
